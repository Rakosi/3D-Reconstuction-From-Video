# 3D-Reconstuction-From-Video-
This project aims to create 3D model of an area using several camera configurations with minimum amount of effort, where the result is accurate enough for using in games, simulations

Until now, we have worked on pedestrian detection from frames of the given video feed that ,s
- Static, doesn't move (except for minor artifacts)
- Sees the area from wide, clear angle
- Has a duration of <= 5 min
- Semi-crowded
