CURRENT BUGS

- Shadow script should be investigated

- The animation of the artificial agents seems out of place
	- Mostly because the animation controller 
	- Their rotation while moving should be cleared (sliding)
- There are problems in RVO where the parameters should be improved.
- Navigation Problems
- Nav mesh agent movement is buggy, as for a second it readjusts itself but it is too visible
- The posture of projected agents should be corrected (Not urgent)
	- This needs to be done in a manner close to navmeshagent where the rotation takes time as natural


FUTURE FEATURES

GUI (Interface)
- Parameters for agents work but not sure if they really affect the agents ? (Needs testing)
- Rewinding for later
- (In future, selecting custom video)

Artificial Agents

- The agents should have varied appereances which are determined randomly
- Because there will be OCEAN on top of the system, there can also be an option which determines the
general mood of the crowd
- The agents should interact with eachother in the presence of near agents (which are also idle, which means 
avaliable for initiating a conversation)
- Multiple collisions can be avoided by holdg the latest collided agent
- Change the model's pivot point so that they can be spawned according to their feet

FUTURE THESÄ°S TO DOS:
- Working on meanshift etc for navigable area generation and debugging using the provided walkableDebug mesh
- Generating the mesh from walkable areas (polygons)
- Adapting the mesh to mutiple layers for ARA*
