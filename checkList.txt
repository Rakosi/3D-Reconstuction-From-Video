CURRENT BUGS

- Shadow script should be investigated
- We should eliminate certain projected agents which are most probably noise which
	- Collides with other projected agents very frequently (only one should be left)
	- Speed limit should be lower
- The animation of the artificial agents seems out of place
	- Mostly because the animation controller 
	- Their rotation while moving should be cleared (sliding)
- The screen resolution can be seemed as a problem, that the size of the video should also
be adjusted to screen resolution rather than other way around. (Especially a problem for fullscreen release)
- There are problems in RVO where the parameters should be improved.
	(For this, it is better to first create the interface that is related to it)
- Navigation Problems
- Nav mesh agent movement is buggy, as for a second it readjusts itself but it is too visible
- The posture of projected agents should be corrected (Not urgent)
	- This needs to be done in a manner close to navmeshagent where the rotation takes time as natural
- Importing the bmp frames for the video takes a lot of time and space (2gb for ~1000 pics). (Pre processing problem)
	This may be solved by converting to jpg files.
	- intra frame ?

FUTURE FEATURES

GUI (Interface)
- Only the selected agents needs to be adjusted
- Toggle showing projected agents
- Parameters for agents work but not sure if they really affect the agents ? (Needs testing)
- Selecting agents and giving them coordinates as goals on the navigable area
- Stop/Resume/Restart the video (Revinding ?)
- Stats for
	- Number of collisions
	- Number of artificial agents
- (In future, selecting custom video)

Artificial Agents

- The agents should have varied appereances which are determined randomly
- Because there will be OCEAN on top of the system, there can also be an option which determines the
general mood of the crowd
- The agents should interact with eachother in the presence of near agents (which are also idle, which means 
avaliable for initiating a conversation)
- 

Projected Agents
- Video as frames
- Interpolation between frames until next frame is rendered

FUTURE THESÄ°S TO DOS:
- Working on meanshift etc for navigable area generation and debugging using the provided walkableDebug mesh
- Generating the mesh from walkable areas (polygons)
- Adapting the mesh to mutiple layers for ARA*
