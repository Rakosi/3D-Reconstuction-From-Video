CURRENT BUGS

- There are problems in RVO where the parameters should be improved.
- WHen the agent is forcily moved, it should return to its position rather than takin away by the crowd
 - Maybe hold the forced position and after a while, set it as destination (unless another destination comes)


FUTURE FEATURES

GUI (Interface)
- (In future, selecting custom video)

Artificial Agents

- Because there will be OCEAN on top of the system, there can also be an option which determines the
general mood of the crowd
- The agents should interact with eachother in the presence of near agents (which are also idle, which means 
avaliable for initiating a conversation)

FUTURE THESÄ°S TO DOS:
- Working on meanshift etc for navigable area generation and debugging using the provided walkableDebug mesh
- Generating the mesh from walkable areas (polygons)
- Adapting the mesh to mutiple layers for ARA*
